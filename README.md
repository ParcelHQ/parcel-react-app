# Setting up

## Intro Notes

- Started this off of the 'starter-kit' version of the theme package
- Simplifying files to use TypeScript and Modern React

## Folder Structure

- @fake-db - Can be deleted once redux is taken out
- assets - Store images, svg's, logos, icons, etc
- components - building blocks of react
- configs - Config file that came with theme. This should eventually be deleted
- data - dummy data
- layouts - Should be made into 1 single layout HOC
- Pages - Different routes of the application
- redux - global state of the app

## Todo

- Remove out redux and replace with context
- Build out interface with necessary components
